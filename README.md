# Restrict Element deletions

This plugin can prevent deletion of elements (entries, assets, categories, products and users) if they are referenced in other elements.

The idea is taken from the plugin [Restrict Asset Delete](https://github.com/la-haute-societe/craft-restrict-asset-delete), improved to apply to all elements, and made Craft 4/5 ready.  

## Installation

`composer require ryssbowh/craft-restrict-deletions:^3.0`
